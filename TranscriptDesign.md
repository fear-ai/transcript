# Transcript Platform - System Architecture & Design

## Executive Summary

This document defines the system architecture and design decisions for the Transcript Platform. It establishes the technical foundation, design principles, and architectural patterns that will guide implementation while maintaining flexibility for iterative development.

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Architectural Pattern
**Decision**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale**: Enables independent development, testing, and deployment of system components while maintaining system integrity

**Layers**:
- **Presentation**: Next.js frontend with component-based architecture
- **Application**: Business logic and orchestration services
- **Data**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for data persistence
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel hosting, Redis caching, AWS S3 storage

### 1.2 Technology Stack

#### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
**Justification**: 
- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization (critical for platform discovery)
- Built-in performance optimizations reduce development overhead
- App Router provides modern routing with improved performance characteristics
- Vercel integration ensures optimal deployment and hosting performance

**Alternatives Considered**: React + Vite (lacks SSR), Gatsby (slower builds), Nuxt.js (Vue ecosystem mismatch)

#### Backend Architecture
**Decision**: Next.js API routes with TypeScript
**Justification**:
- Unified codebase reduces complexity and deployment overhead
- TypeScript ensures type safety across frontend and backend
- API routes provide serverless function capabilities with automatic scaling
- Shared type definitions between frontend and backend

#### Database Selection
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
**Justification**:
- Relational structure essential for complex vendor-feature-pricing relationships
- ACID compliance critical for business data integrity
- Prisma provides type-safe database operations and migrations
- Performance optimized for read-heavy comparison workloads

**Alternatives Considered**: MongoDB (lacks relational benefits), SQLite (scaling limitations), Supabase (vendor lock-in)

### 1.3 Infrastructure Decisions

#### Hosting Platform
**Decision**: Vercel for frontend and API hosting
**Justification**:
- Native Next.js optimization and global CDN distribution
- Automatic deployments from Git with preview environments
- Edge functions for global performance optimization
- Built-in analytics and performance monitoring

#### Database Hosting
**Decision**: PlanetScale for PostgreSQL
**Justification**:
- Serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- Branch-based development workflow for database changes
- Built-in connection pooling and performance optimization
- Global distribution for low-latency access

### 1.4 Current Technology Implementation Status
**Confirmed Technology Choices**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage Phase I**: Compiled files (CSV/JSON → TypeScript at build time)
- **Storage Phase II**: Redis + static files (Upstash + Vercel)
- **Storage Phase III+**: PostgreSQL + Redis (PlanetScale + Upstash)
- **Hosting**: Vercel for deployment and hosting
- **Development**: 5 phases over 10 months, 7 FTE by completion

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Custom build scripts with npm hooks (predev, prebuild) for data compilation
- Hybrid data structure: core fields typed, features as JSON
- Environment variables with .env files for configuration
- Vercel Analytics for initial user behavior tracking

## 2. Data Architecture

### 2.1 Core Data Model

#### Entity Relationships
```
Vendor (1) → (N) Product (1) → (N) Pricing
Product (1) → (N) Feature
User (1) → (N) Review (N) → (1) Product
User (1) → (N) Comparison
```

**Design Principles**:
- **Normalization**: Separate entities for vendors, products, pricing, and features
- **Flexibility**: JSON fields for vendor-specific capabilities while maintaining structure
- **Auditability**: Soft deletes and change tracking for data integrity
- **Performance**: Optimized for read-heavy comparison operations

#### Data Integrity Strategy
**Decision**: Application-level validation with database constraints
**Justification**: 
- Prisma provides type-safe validation at the application layer
- Database constraints ensure referential integrity
- Application validation enables complex business rule enforcement
- Easier testing and maintenance than database-only validation

### 2.2 Data Management Patterns

#### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-tier caching with Redis
**Justification**:
- Vendor data changes infrequently, ideal for aggressive caching
- Redis provides fast access to frequently compared data
- Reduces database load for read-heavy operations
- Enables real-time data updates when needed

#### Data Synchronization
**Decision**: Event-driven updates with manual validation
**Justification**:
- Transcription vendor data changes are infrequent and non-critical
- Manual validation ensures data quality and accuracy
- Simpler architecture than real-time synchronization
- Enables thorough quality checks before publication

## 3. User Experience Design

### 3.1 Design Principles

**Decision**: Show essential information first, expand for details
**Justification**: 
- Reduces cognitive load for users comparing multiple services
- Enables quick scanning while providing depth when needed
- Improves mobile experience with limited screen real estate
- Aligns with user research showing preference for scannable interfaces

#### Comparison-First Design
**Decision**: Optimize for side-by-side comparison workflows
**Justification**:
- Primary user goal is comparing services, not browsing
- Comparison tools drive user engagement and conversion
- Enables informed decision-making through direct comparison
- Differentiates from vendor directory sites

### 3.2 Information Architecture

#### User Type Segmentation
**Decision**: Three distinct user type landing pages with tailored content
**Justification**:
- Research shows distinct needs and decision criteria by user type
- Enables targeted content and feature presentation
- Improves conversion through relevant information hierarchy
- Supports different user journey patterns
